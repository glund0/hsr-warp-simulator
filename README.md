# HSR Warp Calculator
This is the source code for the HSR Warp Simulator.  If your looking to use the simulator, it's available here: [HSR Warp Calculator](https://hsr-warp-simulator.netlify.app/).

There are many fancy JS frameworks that could have been used, but they all seemed like massive overkill.
